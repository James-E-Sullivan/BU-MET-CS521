(Count positive and negative numbers and compute the average of numbers)
Write a program that reads an unspecified number of integers, determines
how many positive and negative values have been read, and computes the
total and average of the input values (not counting zeroes). Your
program ends with the input '0'. Display the average as a floating-point
number.
