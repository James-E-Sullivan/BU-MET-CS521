(Geometry: area of a pentagon)
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the length from the center of a
pentagon to a vertex and computes the area of the pentagon, as shown in the
following figure.

*Figure in book*

The formula for computing the area of a pentagon is:

Area = ((3 * sqrt(3)) / 2) * (s ** 2)

where s is the length of a side.

The side can be computed using the formula:

s = 2r sin (PI/5)       where r is the length from the center of a pentagon
to a vertex.

Example:
    Enter the length from the center to a vertex: 5.5
    The area of the pentagon is 108.61
